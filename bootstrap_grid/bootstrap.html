                    <!-- The Tsar Bomba is the single most physically powerful device ever deployed on Earth.[36] For
                    comparison, the largest weapon ever produced by the U.S., the now-decommissioned B41, had a
                    predicted maximum yield of 25 megatons of TNT (100 PJ). The largest nuclear device ever tested by
                    the U.S. (Castle Bravo) yielded 15 megatons of TNT (63 PJ) because of an unexpectedly high
                    involvement of lithium-7 in the fusion reaction; the preliminary prediction for the yield was from 4
                    to 6 megatons of TNT (17 to 25 PJ). The largest weapons deployed by the Soviet Union were also
                    around 25 megatons of TNT (100 PJ) (e.g., the SS-18 Mod. 3 warhead).

                    The weight and size of the Tsar Bomba limited the range and speed of the specially modified bomber
                    carrying it. Delivery by an intercontinental ballistic missile would have required a much stronger
                    missile (the Proton started its development as that delivery system). It has been estimated that
                    detonating the original 100 Mt design would have released fallout amounting to about 26% of all
                    fallout emitted since the invention of nuclear weapons.[37] It was decided that a full 100 Mt
                    detonation would create a nuclear fallout that was unacceptable in terms of pollution from a single
                    test, as well as a near certainty that the release plane and crew would be destroyed before it could
                    escape the blast radius.[38]

                    The Tsar Bomba was the culmination of a series of high-yield thermonuclear weapons designed by the
                    Soviet Union and the United States during the 1950s (e.g., the Mark 17[39] and B41 nuclear
                    bombs).[1] -->

                    <!-- Despite the creation of the Tu-95V bomb-carrier aircraft, the actual test of the Tsar Bomba was
                    postponed due to political reasons, namely Khrushchev's visit to the United States and a pause in
                    the Cold War. The Tu-95V during this period was flown to Uzin (situated in today's Ukraine) and was
                    used as a training aircraft, therefore it was no longer listed as a combat aircraft. With the
                    beginning of a new round of the Cold War in 1961, the test was resumed. The Tu-95V had all
                    connectors in its automatic release mechanism replaced, the bomb bay doors removed, and the aircraft
                    itself covered with a special reflective white paint. Khrushchev himself personally announced the
                    upcoming tests of the Tsar Bomba in his report at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU on 17 October 1961.

                    The Tsar Bomba was tested on 30 October 1961, flown to its test site by Major Andrei Durnovtsev. The
                    Tu-95 bombers were designed to carry much lighter and smaller weapons (at maximum 27 tons after
                    modernization[26]), meaning the Tsar Bomba was too big to be placed on a missile and too heavy for
                    the planes to transport it to the target with enough fuel.[23]

                    Taking off from the Olenya airfield in the Kola Peninsula, the release plane was accompanied by a
                    Tu-16 observer plane that took air samples and filmed the test. Both aircraft were painted with the
                    special reflective paint to minimize heat damage. Despite this effort, Durnovtsev and his crew were
                    given only a 50% chance of surviving the test.[10]

                    The bomb, weighing 27 metric tons, was so large (8 metres [26 ft] long by 2.1 metres [6 ft 11 in] in
                    diameter) that the Tu-95V had to have its bomb bay doors and fuselage fuel tanks removed[1] (it is
                    also larger than what the original layouts would suggest). The bomb was attached to an 800-kilogram
                    (1,800 lb), 1,600-square-metre (17,000 sq ft) parachute, which gave the release and observer planes
                    time to fly about 45 kilometres (28 mi) away from ground zero, giving them a 50 percent chance of
                    survival.[23] The bomb was released two hours after takeoff from a height of 10,500 m (34,500 ft) on
                    a test target within Sukhoy Nos. The Tsar Bomba detonated at 11:32 (or 11:33) Moscow Time on 30
                    October 1961, over the Mityushikha Bay nuclear testing range (Sukhoy Nos Zone C), north of the
                    Arctic Circle over the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, at a height of 4,200 m ASL
                    (4000 m above the target)[4][22][25] (some sources suggest 3,900 m ASL and 3,700 m above target, or
                    4,500 m). By this time the Tu-95V had already escaped to 39 km (24 mi) away, and the Tu-16 53.5 km
                    (33.2 mi) away. When detonation occurred, the shock wave caught up with the Tu-95V at a distance of
                    115 km (71 mi) and the Tu-16 at 205 km (127 mi), and the Tu-95V dropped 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) in the
                    air because of the shock wave but was able to recover and land safely.[10] According to initial
                    data, the Tsar Bomba had a nuclear yield of 58.6 Mt (245 PJ) (significantly exceeding what the
                    design itself would suggest), and was overestimated at values all the way up to 75 Mt (310 PJ).
